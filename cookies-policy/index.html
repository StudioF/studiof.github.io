		<h1>INFORMATION ON THE USE OF COOKIES</h1>
<p>The website of Studio F - francescofranciosi.com uses cookies and similar technologies to ensure the proper functioning of procedures and improve the user experience of online applications.</p>
<p>This document provides detailed information on the use of cookies and similar technologies, how they are used by Studio F - francescofranciosi.com and how to manage them.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>Cookies are short text fragments (letters and/or numbers) that allow the web server to store information on the client (the browser) to be reused during the same visit to the site (session cookies) or later, even days later (persistent cookies).</p>
<p>Cookies are stored, based on user preferences, by the individual browser on the specific device used (computer, tablet, smartphone).
Similar technologies, such as, for example, web beacons, transparent GIFs, and all forms of local storage introduced with HTML5, can be used to collect information about user behavior and use of services. In the remainder of this document we will refer to cookies and all similar technologies by simply using the term &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Types of cookies</h2>
<p>Based on the characteristics and use of cookies we can distinguish different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Strictly necessary cookies </h3>
<p>The Studio F - francescofranciosi.com website does not use cookies of this type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Analysis and performance cookies </h3>
<p>These are cookies used to anonymously collect and analyze site traffic and usage. These cookies, while not identifying the user, allow, for example, detection of whether the same user returns to log in at different times. They also make it possible to monitor the system and improve its performance and usability. Deactivation of such cookies can be performed without any loss of functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Profiling cookies </h3>
<p>These are permanent cookies used to identify (anonymously and non-anonymously) user preferences and improve the user&rsquo;s browsing experience. The Studio F - francescofranciosi.com website does not use cookies of this type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Third-party cookies </h3>
<p>When visiting a website, you may receive cookies either from the site you visit (&ldquo;owners&rdquo;) or from sites operated by other organizations (&ldquo;third parties&rdquo;). A notable example is the presence of &ldquo;social plugins&rdquo; for Twitter and LinkedIn. These are parts of the visited page generated directly by the aforementioned sites and integrated into the page of the host site. The most common use of social plugins is aimed at sharing content on social networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of these plugins results in the transmission of cookies to and from all sites operated by third parties.
The management of information collected by &ldquo;third parties&rdquo; is governed by the relevant disclosures to which please refer.</p>
<p>For the sake of transparency and convenience, below are the web addresses of the different disclosures and cookie management methods.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514">Twitter disclosures</a><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/security">Twitter (configuration)</a><br>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy">Linkedin informational</a><br>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/">Linkedin (configuration)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Studio F - francescofranciosi.com website also includes certain components transmitted by Google Analytics, a web traffic analysis service provided by Google, Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;).<br>
Again, these are third-party cookies collected and managed anonymously to monitor and improve the performance of the host site (performance cookies).</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to anonymously collect and analyze information about user behavior on the Studio F - francescofranciosi.com website (including the user&rsquo;s IP address).</p>
<p>This information is collected by Google Analytics, which processes it for the purpose of compiling reports for the operators of Studio F - francescofranciosi.com regarding activities on the website itself. This site does not use (and does not allow third parties to use) Google&rsquo;s analytics tool to track or collect personally identifiable information. Google does not associate IP address with any other data held by Google or attempt to link an IP address with a user&rsquo;s identity. Google may also disclose this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this information on Google&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>You may selectively disable the action of Google Analytics by installing the opt-out component provided by Google on your browser. To disable the action of Google Analytics, please refer to the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Tools</a></p>
<h2>Duration of cookies</h2>
<p>Some cookies (session cookies) remain active only until you close your browser or run the logout command. Other cookies &ldquo;survive&rdquo; when the browser is closed and are available on subsequent user visits.  These cookies are called persistent and their duration is set by the server when they are created. In some cases an expiration date is set, in other cases the duration is unlimited. Studio F - francescofranciosi.com does not make use of persistent cookies. However, by browsing the pages of the website Studio F - francescofranciosi.com, you may interact with sites operated by third parties that may create or modify persistent and profiling cookies.</p>
<h2>Managing cookies</h2>
<p>Users can decide whether or not to accept cookies using their browser settings.  Attention: the total or partial disabling of technical cookies may affect the use of site features reserved for registered users. On the contrary, the usability of public content is also possible by disabling cookies completely. Disabling &ldquo;third-party&rdquo; cookies does not affect navigability in any way. The setting can be defined specifically for different sites and web applications. In addition, the best browsers allow you to define different settings for &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; and &ldquo;third-party&rdquo; cookies. As an example, in Firefox, through the menu Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Privacy, you can access a control panel where you can define whether or not to accept different types of cookies and proceed to their removal.</p>
